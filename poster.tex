%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Management of hospital information systems (HIS) is an exceptionally challenging task.
There is an enormous amount of frameworks, textbooks and articles describing the scope from the perspective of medical informatics.
However, the disciplines of business informatics and information systems (IS) provide an even broader view on information systems and their management.
How can knowledge on HIS management be made easily and freely available and how can this knowledge be combined with other knowledge in biomedical and health informatics and in other disciplines?

    Between one and three user clicks were needed to achieve accurate tracking for
      the head sequence. Note the correct handling of the occluded ear, which
      required only a single click. 

      The eye of the running giraffe required eight user interactions, of which three
      marked occlusions.

The most intuitive interface to SNIK is the SNIK Graph visualization, which is based on the Cytoscape.js browser graph library.
SNIK Graph queries the list of classes and their relations from the SPARQL endpoint and transforms them into nodes and edges of the graph.
Exploration options like the “spider worm”, which consists of the shortest path between a start node and an end node together with the end node’s neighbourhood, illustrate the context of a concept.

    We incorporated a background model, where a click informs us not only that `this is how the
    patch looks like', but also for the rest of the frame, `this is how the patch
    does not look like'. 
    
    Can we also \emph{efficiently} use a background tracks model, allowing us
    to reason, `this would be a good track, but part of it can be better
    explained by tracking another point'.

  \indent The cost is interpreted as a directed acyclic graph
  with weights on the nodes and edges. The nodes encode candidate positions,
  and the edges the transition costs between candidates. Additional edges
  (dashed) allow occlusion transitions which skip frames.

  The optimal track is found with a modification of Dijkstra's shortest path
  search. The search was speed up by lower bounding the cost, and lazily
  evaluating the accurate cost only where necessary to find the global optimum.
