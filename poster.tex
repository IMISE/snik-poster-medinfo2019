Management of hospital information systems (HIS) is an exceptionally challenging task.
There is an enormous amount of frameworks, textbooks and articles describing the scope from the perspective of medical informatics.
However, the disciplines of business informatics and information systems (IS) provide an even broader view on information systems and their management.
How can knowledge on HIS management be made easily and freely available and how can this knowledge be combined with other knowledge in biomedical and health informatics and in other disciplines?

The most intuitive interface to SNIK is the SNIK Graph visualization, which is based on the Cytoscape.js browser graph library.
SNIK Graph queries the list of classes and their relations from the SPARQL endpoint and transforms them into nodes and edges of the graph.
Exploration options like the “spider worm”, which consists of the shortest path between a start node and an end node together with the end node’s neighbourhood, illustrate the context of a concept.
